### Hi! 👋

Hi! My name is Won, and I am a junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Astrophysics at Tufts University. I was born in Korea but lived in Japan my entire life, recently moving to the United States to attend college. I was introduced to programming in high school and have fallen in love with it ever since, pushing myself forward through various projects, and my journey is continuing throughout my life at Tufts.

I have a strong foundation in programming in the languages of C++, Python, and Java, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, through my experiences undergoing projects throughout the summer and school year. By engaging in multiple virtual internship programs while simultaneously working on a project to connect students and English tutors by allowing them to schedule sessions with one another, I am continuing to expand my knowledge of programming in the hopes of pursuing a career in the field of computer science.
