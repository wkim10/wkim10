### Hi! üëã

Hi! My name is Won, and I am a senior studying Computer Science and Astrophysics at Tufts University. I was born in Korea but lived in Japan my entire life, recently moving to the U.S. to attend college. I was introduced to programming in high school and have fallen in love with it ever since.

Most recently, I was an intern at Electronic Arts (EA) on the Employee Experience Engineering Team (EEX), undertaking projects to make the lives of EA employees smoother and easier. In general, I love building websites and applications, whether it be for non-profit organizations through my university‚Äôs JumboCode organization or for the general Tufts community through personal projects with other passionate developers.
